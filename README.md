# NEXUS - v1.0 (still under construction...)

A reusable backend/administration tool targeting, currently, _**small to medium businesses and entrepreneurs/influencers**_.
It supports multiple operating systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux) and includes a native handy, intuitive and easy to use GUI control and 
administration panel interface.
Through it, finally, the internet may be now part of your source of income, solely requiring a basic frontend client and some easy to complete
guided configuration steps. It can be setup even locally, with cheap hardware and no cloud hosting required!
Basically, it allows the publishing of custom content, similarly to a blog or news website, and the sale of almost any goods/services desired, 
being designed to support a wide variety of payment options (such as CC and **PIX**).

**Have in mind this tool is not yet ready for use and is still being built and tested.**
