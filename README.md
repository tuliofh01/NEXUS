# NEXUS - v1.0 (still under construction...)
Made and maintained by TÃºlio Horta, _**the Duke**_.

## Software description:
A reusable backend/administration tool targeting, currently, _**small to medium businesses and entrepreneurs/influencers**_. \
It supports multiple operating systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux) and includes a native handy, intuitive and easy to use GUI control and administration panel interface. \
Through it, **finally**, the internet may be now part of your source of income, solely requiring a basic frontend client and some easy to complete guided configuration steps. It can be setup even locally, with cheap hardware and no cloud hosting required! \
Basically, it allows the publishing of custom content, similarly to a blog or news website, and the sale of almost any goods/services desired, being designed to support a wide variety of payment options (such as CC and _PIX_).

## Warning: 
This repository is proprietary. Check the license file, it will soon be updated. **Also have in mind this tool is not yet ready for commercial nor experimental use and is still being built and tested. Once finished, it will probably be sold and activated via licensing keys.**
